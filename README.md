# Build-Image-Caption-Generator-with-CNN-LSTM
You saw an image and your brain can easily tell what the image is about, but can a computer tell what the image is representing? Computer vision researchers worked on this a lot and they considered it impossible until now! With the advancement in Deep learning techniques, availability of huge datasets and computer power, we can build models that can generate captions for an image.

This is what we are going to implement in this Python based project where we will use deep learning techniques of Convolutional Neural Networks and a type of Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) together.
